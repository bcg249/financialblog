           <p>One of the best reasons to put the effort into organizing your finances is so that your money can start working for you. Knowing where every dollar is and what it is up to is the best way to make sure that your dollars are busy working for you instead of someone else. But if you don't know where your money is, you have no idea what it is up to!
           </p>
            <br>
            <p>Thus, your first task at hand is to track down every dollar you own or owe. Sit down with a piece of paper and your stack of mail (or emails) and start writing down the name of every institution with which you have an account. This would include banks, credit card companies, mortgage lenders, student loan holders, or retirement accounts. </p> 
           </p>
           <br>
           
           <p>This may seem overwhelming at first, but luckily there are lots of tools to help you to keep track of all of your dollars and determine your overall net worth. This is the number you need to know and track and work to increase through good financial managmeent. You can check out some of your different choices for account management on our <a href="tools.html">tools</a> page.</p>
              <br>
              
           <p>Using a website like <a href=https://www.mint.com/> Mint</a> means that you can at any moment you can see what your dollars are up to and make sure that you aren't accruing any unreasonable fees or penalties.  You can also make sure that you are paying your bills on time and you can keep track of your retirement and other accounts all in one place without having to log into many different accounts and write down your balances or other details. All the hard work is done for you and very quickly you can get on top of all of your financial to dos. </p>
